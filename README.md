# Landing-Page
TOP project - Flexbox

## Reflection
Overall, a very successfull and fun project.

### What went well
Sections two and three went particularily well. I was anticipating more difficulty setting up the cards, but it proved simple. The only tricky part was getting the size and space between correct to match the rest of the page. Section three was particularily fun: getting the quote attribution to align properly was really interesting.

## Where to improve
Getting the placeholder image to the right size was very difficult. I ended up going with an image instead to have it behave properly (aspect ration and such). The sign up button was also tricky, because, as I am realizing as I am writing this, I didn't actually make it into a button. The button element would have solved a lot of my issues. I'll fix it if I ever go back through this project.
